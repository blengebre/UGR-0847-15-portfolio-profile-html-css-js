                            Location: Lake Tana is situated in the northwestern Ethiopian Highlands in the Amhara region, near the city of Bahir Dar.
                            Size: It covers an area of approximately 3,673 square kilometers (1,418 square miles) and has an average depth of around 9 meters (30 feet), with its maximum depth reaching about 14 meters (46 feet).
